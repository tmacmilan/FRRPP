Author：FengXiaodong @uestc

About
Matlab code for feature-regularized dynamics model based on reinforced Poisson process (FRRPP). This work is under review and it will be public if it is accepted by some places.

Datasets
(1)	Government Sina Weibo dataset. It is Our own crawled dataset as governmentWeibodata.csv.
(2)	General Sina Weibo dataset from https://www.aminer.cn/influencelocality (J. Zhang, B. Liu, J. Tang, T. Chen, J. Li, Social influence locality for modeling retweeting behaviors, in: International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence, IJCAI, 2013, pp. 2761–2767.)

Implementation 

Main.m: read dataset, process dataset, run FRRPP
